# Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

I'm a bilingual data reporter interested in data visualization and analysis, news app development and information design.

👩‍💻 I'm currently a data reporter for [Stateline](https://stateline.org/author/ahernandez/) where I cover criminal justice, but I have previously worked for ABC News, USA Today, NBC4 Washington and The Diamondback – an independent student newspaper at the University of Maryland. I graduated in May 2023 with degrees in journalism and information science.
