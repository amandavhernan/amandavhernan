# Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

I'm a bilingual data journalist looking for work in data visualization and analysis or information design.

👩‍💻 I'm currently a data journalism intern for ABC News, but I have previously worked for USA Today, NBC4 Washington, and The Diamondback – an independent student newspaper at the University of Maryland. I'm set to graduate in May 2023 with degrees in journalism and information science.
